Reasons not to work with VistaSoft:
- There is no versioning (Release v1.0 on GitHub is from June 2013).
- The tools are outdated (VistaSoft relies on SPM5 or SPM8, who knows?).

- We are working with an (undocumented) unorganized collection sent to us by BMH.
- The readme often says "file X has to be in folder Y and has to be named Z".
- The code relies on other packages (FreeSurfer is "optional", AFNI is not mentioned).
- Some tools documented are not in the toolbox (e.g. "mrVista").
- Some tools in the toolbox are not documented (e.g. "mrAlign").
- The documentation frequently recommends "addpath(genPath('...'))".
- According to our own standards, we cannot work with VistaSoft.
