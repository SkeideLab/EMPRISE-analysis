Sensory cortices contain topographic maps reflecting the structure of sensory organs. Are the cortical representation and processing of numerosity organized topographically, even though no sensory organ has a numerical structure? Using high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging (at a field strength of 7 teslas), we described neural populations tuned to small numerosities in the human parietal cortex. They are organized topographically, forming a numerosity map that is robust to changes in low-level stimulus features. The cortical surface area devoted to specific numerosities decreases with increasing numerosity, and the tuning width increases with preferred numerosity. These organizational properties extend topographic principles to the representation of higher-order abstract features in the association cortex.},

	abstract = {Humans and many animals analyze sensory information to estimate quantities that guide behavior and decisions. These quantities include numerosity (object number) and object size. Having recently demonstrated topographic maps of numerosity, we ask whether the brain also contains maps of object size. Using ultra-high-field (7T) functional MRI and population receptive field modeling, we describe tuned responses to visual object size in bilateral human posterior parietal cortex. Tuning follows linear Gaussian functions and shows surround suppression, and tuning width narrows with increasing preferred object size. Object size-tuned responses are organized in bilateral topographic maps, with similar cortical extents responding to large and small objects. These properties of object size tuning and map organization all differ from the numerosity representation, suggesting that object size and numerosity tuning result from distinct mechanisms. However, their maps largely overlap and object size preferences correlate with numerosity preferences, suggesting associated representations of these two quantities. Object size preferences here show no discernable relation to visual position preferences found in visuospatial receptive fields. As such, object size maps (much like numerosity maps) do not reflect sensory organ structure but instead emerge within the brain. We speculate that, as in sensory processing, optimization of cognitive processing using topographic maps may be a common organizing principle in association cortex. Interactions between object size and numerosity maps may associate cognitive representations of these related features, potentially allowing consideration of both quantities together when making decisions.},

To date, however, all of these maps were driven by the visual system. Here, we ask whether there are supramodal topographic maps representing cognitive dimensions irrespective of the stimulated sensory modality. We measured haptically and visually driven numerosity-selective neural responses using model-based analyses and ultra-high field (7T) fMRI. We found topographically organized neural populations tuned to haptic numerosity. The responses to visual or haptic numerosity shared a similar cortical network. However, the maps of the two modalities only partially overlap. Thus, although both visual and haptic numerosities are processed in a similar supramodal functional network, the underlying neural populations may be related, but distinct. Therefore, we hypothesize that overlap between modality-specific maps facilitates cross-modal interactions and supramodal representation of cognitive quantities.},

Though the focus of studies of numerosity perception lays on the parietal and frontal cortices, the ability to perceive numerosity by a range of species suggests that subcortical nuclei may be implicated in the process. Recently, we have uncovered tuned neural responses to haptic numerosity in the human cortex. Here, we questioned whether subcortical nuclei are also engaged in perception of haptic numerosity. To that end, we utilized a task of haptic numerosity exploration, together with population receptive field model of numerosity selective responses measured at ultra-high field MRI (7T). We found tuned neural responses to haptic numerosity in the bilateral putamen. Similar to the cortex, the population receptive fields tuning width increased with numerosity. The tuned responses to numerosity in the putamen extend its role in cognition and propose that the motor-sensory loops of the putamen and basal ganglia might take an active part in numerosity perception and preparation for future action.},

However, distinct behavioural performance suggests that small numerosities, i.e. subitizing range, are implemented differently in the brain than larger numerosities. Prior work has shown that neural populations selectively responding (i.e. hemodynamic responses) to small numerosities are organized into a network of topographical maps. Here, we investigate how neural populations respond to large numerosities, well into the ANS. Using 7â€‰T fMRI and biologically-inspired analyses, we found a network of neural populations tuned to both small and large numerosities organized within the same topographic maps. These results demonstrate a continuum of numerosity preferences that progressively cover both the subitizing range and beyond within the same numerosity map, suggesting a single neural mechanism. We hypothesize that differences in map properties, such as cortical magnification and tuning width, underlie known differences in behaviour.},

	abstract = {The field of cognitive neuroscience is weighing evidence about whether to move from the current standard field strength of 3 Tesla (3T) to ultra-high field (UHF) of 7T and above. The present study contributes to the evidence by comparing a computational cognitive neuroscience paradigm at 3T and 7T. The goal was to evaluate the practical effects, i.e. model predictive power, of field strength on a numerosity task using accessible pre-processing and analysis tools. Previously, using 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging and biologically-inspired analyses, i.e. population receptive field modelling, we discovered topographical organization of numerosity-selective neural populations in human parietal cortex. Here we show that these topographic maps are also detectable at 3T. However, averaging of many more functional runs was required at 3T to reliably reconstruct numerosity maps. On average, one 7T run had about four times the model predictive power of one 3T run. We believe that this amount of scanning would have made the initial discovery of the numerosity maps on 3T highly infeasible in practice. Therefore, we suggest that the higher signal-to-noise ratio and signal sensitivity of UHF MRI is necessary to build mechanistic models of the organization and function of our cognitive abilities in individual participants.},

Participants' attention was focused on either black or white dots, while we systematically changed the numerosity of black, white, and total dots. Using 7Â T fMRI, we show that the numerosity-tuned neural populations respond only when attention is focused on their preferred numerosity, irrespective of the unattended or total numerosities. Without attention, responses to preferred numerosity are suppressed. Unlike traditional effects of attention in the visual cortex, where attention enhances already existing responses, these results suggest that attention is required to drive numerosity-selective responses.},

Previously, we uncovered neural populations selectively tuned to numerosities organized in a network of topographic maps in human association cortex. Here we investigate whether these numerosity maps are also involved in the processing of symbolic numbers, using 7T fMRI and a number-detection task. We recruited 7 participants (3 females) and found that the numerosity map at the temporal-occipital cortex (NTO) also responds to symbolic numbers. Furthermore, we found that numerosity-tuned neuronal populations at the NTO map in the left hemisphere are tuned to symbolic numbers. These results reveal different functions of the numerosity maps and support a link between numerosity representation and symbolic number processing in the ventral temporal-occipital cortex.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Humans and other animals share an intuitive "number sense" to approximately represent numerosity. However, humans possess a unique ability to process number symbols (e.g., Arabic numbers). It has been argued that the human understanding of symbolic numbers is rooted in our ability to numerosity perception. Here we investigate whether numerosity-tuned neuronal populations organized at a network of topographic maps also respond to symbolic numbers. We find one of the maps at the temporal-occipital cortex is involved in symbolic numerical cognition and the neuronal populations are tuned to numbers.

	abstract = {Human early visual cortex response amplitudes monotonically increase with numerosity (object number), regardless of object size and spacing. However, numerosity is typically considered a high-level visual or cognitive feature, while early visual responses follow image contrast in the spatial frequency domain. We find that, at fixed contrast, aggregate Fourier power (at all orientations and spatial frequencies) follows numerosity closely but nonlinearly with little effect of object size, spacing or shape. This would allow straightforward numerosity estimation from spatial frequency domain image representations. Using 7T fMRI, we show monotonic responses originate in primary visual cortex (V1) at the stimulus's retinotopic location. Responses here and in neural network models follow aggregate Fourier power more closely than numerosity. Truly numerosity tuned responses emerge after lateral occipital cortex and are independent of retinotopic location. We propose numerosity's straightforward perception and neural responses may result from the pervasive spatial frequency analyses of early visual processing.},

The capabilities of the proposed methodology are evaluated via a realistic synthetic fMRI-like dataset, and demonstrated using a test case of a challenging fMRI study, which verifies that the proposed approach produces substantially more consistent results compared to the standard design matrix method.

	abstract = {Sensory and motor cortices each contain multiple topographic maps with the structure of sensory organs (such as the retina or cochlea) mapped onto the cortical surface. These sensory maps are hierarchically organized. For example, visual field maps contain neurons that represent increasingly large parts of visual space with increasingly complex responses. Some visual neurons respond to stimuli with a particular numerosity â€” the number of objects in a set. We recently discovered a parietal topographic numerosity map in which neural numerosity preferences progress gradually across the cortical surface, analogous to sensory maps. Following this analogy, we hypothesized that there may be multiple numerosity maps. Numerosity perception is implicated in many cognitive functions, including foraging, multiple object tracking, dividing attention, decision-making and mathematics. Here we use ultra-high-field (7 Tesla, 7T) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and neural-model-based analyses to reveal numerosity-selective neural populations organized into six widely separated topographic maps in each hemisphere. Although we describe subtle differences between these maps, their properties are very similar, unlike in sensory map hierarchies. These maps are found in areas implicated in object recognition, motion perception, attention control, decision-making and mathematics. Multiple numerosity maps may allow interactions with these cognitive systems, suggesting a broad role for quantity processing in supporting many perceptual and cognitive functions.},
